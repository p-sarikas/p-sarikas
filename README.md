# Hi, I'm Panagiotis 👋

Mechanical Engineer and Robotics Engineer with 3+ years of experience across
robotics systems, mechanical design, and engineering projects.
Currently completing an MSc in Robotics at TU Delft.

I work at the intersection of mechanical engineering, robotics, and control,
with hands-on experience in ROS2, C++, Python, and simulation-based development.
My interests include autonomous systems, robot dynamics and control, and
engineering-driven robotics solutions.

## 🚀 Projects
- **ROS2 Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation**

  Implements an autonomous driving system for a simulated mobile robot (Mirte) in ROS 2 (Humble), enabling navigation through a cone-defined track with obstacle avoidance and pedestrian stopping. Combines 3D point-cloud processing (PCL) and 2D vision-based pedestrian detection (OpenCV) to generate safe velocity commands.


- **Simulation of an Electronic Differential for Electric Vehicles**

  Modeling and simulation of an electronic differential for a lightweight EV using Ackermann steering. Compares DC motor and PMSM-based in-wheel architectures with advanced control (FOC, SVPWM) to evaluate vehicle stability and traction.

- **Imitation Learning for Vision-Based Robot Control**

  Imitation learning–based control of a mobile robot using RGB camera input only. Learns a policy that maps visual observations to discrete navigation actions and evaluates performance both offline and in simulation.
